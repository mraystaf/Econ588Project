# Econ588Project
Econ 588 Project for exploring censored regression models for non-normal underlying distributions


Andrew - Gamma (Income?)
Michael - Negative Binomial (Applying to med school, number of SO's until you get married)
Benj - Poisson

For each distribution:
  - Come up with a reason why the data may be distributed this way (real-life example)
  - Generate random data
  - Find the likelihood function
  - Find marginal effects
  - Compare marginal effects
